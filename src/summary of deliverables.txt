From the description I was able to:
 1. make an interactive tic tac toe game 
 2. store results of different users in text files (under results). the results are based on the name of the user/player.
 3.display last player who interacted with the game and give them a chance to change upon opening the browser 
 4. store user info with cookies
 5. keep track of scores, you should be able to see this in the various interfaces for users.
 6. work with sass. 


to run the code:
 1. copy the tic tac toe into htdocs directory under xampp or wampp or whichever server you have installed
 2. turn xampp or wampp server on
 3. type localhost/tictactoe in the browser
 4. select src/
 5. the game should be ready to play :)
